# \[WIP] Password generator
Simple password generator written in Python using Brute-Force technique.

Password generator allows you to specify minimum requirements for the password (password length, amount of digits etc.)

It also provides method *generate_passwords_to_file()* which saves generated passwords into 'passwords.txt' file and prints total amount of generated passwords as well as execution time of the script.

## How to use
Simply run 'python password_cracker.py' in your console. Wait for results.

Execution time is dependent on the complexity of password specified - you can modify default values provided in object's initializer.
